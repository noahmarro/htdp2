## Functions and Programs

### Composing Functions

In general, a program should consist of one function per task and a main function that puts it all together.

> Define one function per task.

The advantage of following this slogan is that you get reasonably small functions, each of which is easy to comprehend and whose composition is easy to understand.
Better yet, if you ever need to change a part of the program due to some change to the problem statement, it tends to be much easier.

### Global Constants

We use uppercase letters for global constants to easily distinguish such variables from others.

> For every constant mentioned in a problem statement, introduce one constant definition.
